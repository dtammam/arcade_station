## 🤖 AI & Technology

The current state of generative AI from 2024-2025 made this project possible:

- **Cursor** and **Anthropic's Claude 3.7 with thinking** - Jesus Christ, did that make this possible

- **ChatGPT** for endless "phone calls" from the car to learn what certain things are and how they work
- **Deepseek R1** for helping me come up with a framework to use for [planning this effort](PLAN.md)

## 🎮 Rhythm Game Community
- **[clue](https://clue.media)** for the original [ddr-picker](https://github.com/evanclue/ddr-picker) which inspired my [PowerShell rewritten fork](https://github.com/dtammam/ddr-picker) and ongoing developments which led to Arcade Station. Also - the awesome art assets!!
- **[din](https://github.com/dinsfire64)** and **[teejusb](https://github.com/teejusb)** for being awesome about sharing ideas, recommendations, feedback for things like [ITGmania](https://www.itgmania.com) compatible modules, art, user experience considerations, STAC board firmware and lights reset utilities
- **[Ashley Philbrick](https://mysticsteps.com)** for listening to me ramble about progress on an endless to-do list for the last few months and providing encouragement
- **The [Pegasus project](https://pegasus-frontend.org)** and their Discord community for answering my questions about QML formatting and why their thing worked

## 👥 Friends & Testers
