## ðŸ’» Multi-Monitor Laptop Scenario

In this example, I'm demonstrating a **portable multi-monitor setup** using a Surface Laptop Studio connected to two external displays. This configuration allows me to:
- Run Arcade Station as the front-end interface
- Manage and launch ITGmania (a rhythm game) and Megatouch Maxx Crown (a touchscreen arcade game)
- Display game banners and song information on a secondary monitor using the dynamic marquee feature

**Why a laptop setup?** This demonstrates Arcade Station's flexibility - you don't need dedicated arcade hardware to create an excellent gaming experience. A laptop with external monitors provides:
- Portability for setting up temporary arcade stations
- Multi-monitor support for dynamic marquee displays
- Full functionality without permanent hardware installation

**Important:** Arcade Station works with virtually any hardware configuration - from laptops to dedicated cabinets to home PCs. This example shows just one approach, but you can adapt it to your specific needs, games, and hardware. Whether you're building a full-size MAME cabinet, a rhythm game station, or just want to organize your PC games, the same core functionality applies.

## ðŸ”§ Multi-Monitor Laptop Installation Walkthrough

I'm standing in front of my laptop, logged in as the local Administrator, and have downloaded the latest version of Arcade Station.
It is a Windows-based PC, currently running Windows 11.

1. I've disabled UAC.

2. I'll launch the installer and select `Next`.

3. I'll choose an install location. By default, it wants to install in your user profile. I'm okay with this and will select `Next`. You'll then see the files copying to the location.

4. We're notified about the different types of games to configure. I'll leave the checkbox checked as I do want to configure my game, Megatouch Maxx, and select `Next`.

   <img src=../assets/images/example/laptop/40.png width="70%">

5. I'm asked if I want to use ITGmania. I do, so I'll leave it and select `Next`.
- The installer detected that I have it installed in the default location and is referencing it automatically
- It is set to use a default bundled picture for ITGmania's banner
- It has an option to use the dynamic marquee module which will show songs that I pick on my 2nd display when I pick them, which I'll leave checked

6. I'm asked if I have any binary-based games to configure, which I do (Megatouch Maxx).
- I'll type Megatouch for the name
- I'll select browse and pick the .exe used to open my game
- I'll pick my banner image (the art for the game) that'll show up on the 2nd display. When I click Browse, I see a set of bundled art (which includes Megatouch - otherwise, I'd pick from my PC.)
- I don't have any other games to configure (which I'd do by selecting `Add Another Game`) so I'll select `Next` once done.

   <img src="../assets/images/example/laptop/63.png" width="70%">

7. I'm asked if I want to setup any MAME games. I don't right now, so I'll select `Next`.
- But if I did, I'd check the box, input my `mame.exe` path and `mame.ini` path, then `Add Another MAME-Based Game`, filling it out similarly to how we did the binaries (with the addition of ROMs and save states). 

   <img src="../assets/images/example/laptop/70.png" width="70%">

8. I'm asked to setup key bindings and processes to kill - very important.
- In the `Key Bindings` tab, there are a set of default key bindings to do things like reset us back to the menu, close Arcade Station, and even start streaming if you'd like.
- If you have any custom scripts or apps you want to run with a button press, you can add them here.
- The main one for me are `Reset back to menu` (which closes the games and brings you back) which will get triggered if I click `Ctrl + Spacebar`. 
- I'm happy with these bindings for now, so I'll leave them - but I can add, edit, or remove as needed.

9. Near the top, there's a `Process Management` tab. This is the list of processes to close when resetting back to the menu or exiting Arcade Station. 
- Since I'm adding Megatouch, I need to add the processes it launches to make sure they get closed.
- I added the list to the top and selected `Next`, leaving everything else.

   <img src="../assets/images/example/laptop/81.png" width="70%">
   <img src="../assets/images/example/laptop/82.png" width="70%">

10. I'm asked about setting up my display. This is for a dynamic marquee, or a "billboard" of sorts that shows the art for the game you pick.
- I click `Show Monitor Numbers` which shows a little number on each of my display, so I know which is identified as what for the system.
- I want it on my right screen (or `Monitor 1` for Arcade Station's sake), so I'll select it.
- I can choose the background color, since the dynamic marquee supports transparent .png files. I'm happy with `Black` so I'll leave it.
- I can also change the default menu image here if I want for when we're in the menu. I'm happy with the default, so I'll leave it checked and will select `Next`.

   <img src="../assets/images/example/laptop/90.png" width="70%">
   <img src="../assets/images/example/laptop/91.png" width="70%">

11. I'm asked about setting up Kiosk Mode, which would turn my computer into a purpose built station (when you turn it on, it'll auto-login and start arcade station - nothing else). Since this is just my portable machine, I won't. But if I were to, I'd check the box to `Enable Kiosk Mode` and input the credentials to automatically logon with. I'll select `Next`.

    <img src="../assets/images/example/laptop/100.png" width="70%">

12. I'm asked about utilities to setup:
- There's a light reset program option, which lets you pick your light controller if you want to reset them between game selections
- There's a VPN client setting, which lets you pick your VPN client and configuration file for autoconnecting when the system turns on
- There's a streaming setting, so that you can pick your streaming program like OBS to have it auto-started on a button press from the key bindings earlier
- By default, we install an audio app that is used to show volume controls in kiosk mode whenever we use it.
- We also give an option to save screenshots to a folder, which will map to a button press from the key bindings earlier
- I'll leave this all as default and select `Next`. 

   <img src="../assets/images/example/laptop/110.png" width="70%">

13. I'll be shown my summary, which will include all of the settings I picked. When ready, I'll select `Finish` and will receive a confirmation dialog, prompting me to launch it for the first time if I setup kiosk mode for any security prompts.

    <img src="../assets/images/example/laptop/120.png" width="70%">

    <img src="../assets/images/example/laptop/121.png" width="35%">

14. My install directory will open and I'll get a final confirmation box. Arcade Station is installed!

## ðŸŽ² A Basic Example Workflow with Arcade Station

1. I'll right-click `launch_arcade_station.bat` and run it as administrator to start Arcade Station. If I set kiosk mode up, after this, I'd reboot.

2. Arcade Station will launch, showing the menu on my main screen and my `dynamic marquee` on my 2nd monitor (`Monitor 1` from the setup).
- We see ITGmania and Megatouch, just as you'd expect.
- I want to play some Megatouch, so I'll select it either by clicking or by using the arrow key and pressing `Enter`.

3. After launching Megatouch, it kicks off the program we set, and boots into the game. It's quite fun.
- The dynamic marquee changed to the banner image for Megatouch set in the installer.
- Once I'm done, I'll use the reset to menu key binding (by default, `Ctrl + Spacebar`) which will close all programs (including the processes we added for Megatouch), closing the game and getting us back to the menu.

4. Once I'm done, I'll use the reset to menu key binding (by default, `Ctrl + Spacebar`) which will close all programs (including the processes we added for Megatouch), closing the game and getting us back to the menu.

   <img src="../assets/images/example/laptop/200.jpg" width="70%">

5. Now I'd like to play ITGmania, so I'll do the same thing - pick the entry and launch it.
- The dynamic marquee changed to the banner image for ITGmania and boots into the game.

   <img src="../assets/images/example/laptop/230.jpg" width="70%">

6. I'm going to play the song Kiss Me Red, classic song.
- Because we enabled the Simply Love dynamic marquee module, the banner changes to the song art for Kiss Me Red.
- Once the song ends and we go back to the song selection menu, the ITGmania banner gets set back.

7. I've had a great time today, and now that I'm done, I want to close Arcade Station. I do that with the default key binding of (`Ctrl + F10`.)
