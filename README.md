## ✨ Features

- Cross-platform core functionality (Windows, Linux, and macOS)
- Easy-to-use installation wizard (Windows installer in this release)
- Game configuration for ITGMania, binary games, and MAME

## 📋 Requirements

### 💻 Technical
- [Python 3.12.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3129/)
- Windows 10/11 (current release)
- Administrator privileges for installation
- 500MB free disk space

### 🔒 UAC
Arcade Station is designed primarily for private, arcade-style machines running in a kiosk-like environment.

While scripts may function with User Access Control (UAC) enabled, the full experience (including shell replacement and seamless startup) only works reliably with UAC disabled. In standard desktop setups, functionality may be partial or inconsistent. We recommend:

- UAC disabled (Never notify)
- Autologin with the local user
- Trusted software only
- No general-purpose use
- Physical access limited to trusted users

This configuration ensures the system behaves as intended and delivers a smooth, arcade-style experience.
This recommendation is based on practical needs for stability and predictability in arcade-style deployments. Use at your discretion.

## 💾 Installation
