## ‚ú® Features

- Cross-platform core functionality (Windows, Linux, and macOS)
- Easy-to-use installation wizard (Windows installer in this release)
- Game configuration for ITGMania, binary games, and MAME

## üìã Requirements

### üíª Technical
- [Python 3.12.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3129/)
- Windows 10/11 (current release)
- Administrator privileges for installation
- 500MB free disk space

### üîí UAC
Arcade Station is designed primarily for private, arcade-style machines running in a kiosk-like environment.

While scripts may function with UAC enabled, the full experience - including shell replacement and seamless startup - only works reliably with UAC disabled. In standard desktop setups, functionality may be partial or inconsistent. We recommend:

- UAC disabled
- Autologin with the local user
- Trusted software only
- No general-purpose use
- Physical access limited to trusted users

This configuration ensures the system behaves as intended and delivers a smooth, arcade-style experience.
This recommendation is based on practical needs for stability and predictability in arcade-style deployments. Use at your discretion.
