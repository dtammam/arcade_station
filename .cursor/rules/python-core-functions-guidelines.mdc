# Python Core Functions Guidelines

## Line Length
Ensure that all lines do not exceed 79 characters, following the PEP 8 standard.

## Docstring Style
Use the Google docstring style for documentation, as referenced in PLAN.MD.

## TOML Parsing
Use `tomllib` for parsing TOML files instead of the `toml` library.

## Function Placement
- Define new utility functions in this file unless they are truly specific to another file.
- Maintain consistency by always placing new utility functions in this file.
