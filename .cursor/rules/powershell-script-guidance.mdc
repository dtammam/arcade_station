# PowerShell Scripts Guidelines

## Execution Policy
- System is configured to use `Bypass` execution policy for all PowerShell scripts
- This is set during installation via `launch_arcade_station.bat`
- No need to add `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass` to individual script calls

## Formatting
- Use an indent size of 4 spaces.
- Ensure there is a newline at the end of the file.
